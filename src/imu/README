IMU reads calibration parameters from imu_calib.txt

File should have only numbers, no comments, no text, etc.
Spaces, tabs, newlines do not matter, data is parsed from left to right, top to bottom.

Accelerometer calibration:
	      - 9 numbers for gain matrix
	      - 3 numbers for offset
Gyroscope:
	- 9 numbers for gain matrix.
	- 3 numbers for offset
Magnetometer:
	- 9 numbers for gain matrix
	- 3 numbers for offset
Accelerometer temp. compensation:
	      - 1 number for acc z axis temp. coefficient.
	      - 1 number for temperature during calibration.
Gyro temperature compensation:
     - 3 numbers for temp. dependant coefficients.
     - 3 numbers for temp. independant coefficient.
     - 1 number for temp. at which calibration was performed.
