This program is designed to be compiled and ran on a beagleboard.
On a linux pc, you can run:
   make pc_test
to verify syntax.

# Compiling
To compile do:
   make
That will generate a executable called cmd

# Running
To run do
   ./cmd v0 v1 v2 v3
If no arguments are given, all motors will be enabled. Else, vi can be either 0/1 to disable/enable each motor.

To change motor speed, write to mot_control.file or to stdin.
Examples:
- Using mot_control.file:
   ./cmd &
   # startup motors
   echo "50 50 50 50" >> mot_control.file
   # stop motors
   echo "0 0 0 0" >> mot_control.file
   # note the >>, if only > is used, then each echo will clear the file, and the program will not work.
- Using stdin
   ./cmd
   # startup motors
   50 50 50 50
   # stop motors
   0 0 0 0
