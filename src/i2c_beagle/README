This program is designed to be compiled and ran on a beagleboard.

# Compiling
To compile do:
   make
That will generate a executable called cmd. this target will communicate via kernel msg queues, it will not read from stdin.

To build a target that will read from stdin in, do
   make stdin
To run do using stdin, do:
   ./cmd v0 v1 v2 v3
If no arguments are given, all motors will be enabled. Else, vi can be either 0/1 to disable/enable each motor.
This target will targets arguments such as "50 60 70 90", setting motor speeds v0=50, v1=60, etc.

To build a fake target, that does not requiere i2c and is usefull for debugging/testing, do:
   make pc_test
This target will communicate via kernel msg queues, and will NOT write to i2c, but will still answer as if it were writing.
